"""
    order_tw_by_dissections_threads(graph, duration,nparallel=10, max_imbalances=[1.0, 0.8, 0.6], seed=4242)
Computes an approximation of the upper bound of the treewidth of the graph g and
an order for elimination using the iterative dissection (using flow cutter algorithm)
several times in parallel and select the best_order and treewidth.


# Arguments
- `graph::SimpleGraph{Int64}`: the graph to analyse.
- `duration::Int64` : the maximum time to wait (in seconds) for running iterative_dissection multiple times.
- `nparallel::Int64 = 10` the number of calls in parallel to iterative_dissection.
- `max_imbalance::Float64 = 0.6` criteria for selecting cuts that will build the separator.
- `max_nsample::Int64 = 20` the number of calls to flowcutter with random inputs.
- `seed::Int64 = 4242` the base seed for the RNG sampling the inputs of flowcutter and the choosen one cut for separator.

# Return
- `order::Vector{Int64}` an array of vertices index.
- `treewidth::Int64` the approximation of treewidth.
